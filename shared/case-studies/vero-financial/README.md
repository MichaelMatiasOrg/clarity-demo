# Vero Financial - Fictional Case Study

A realistic fictional fintech company used to demonstrate identity verification risks.

## Story

Vero Financial is a high-growth fintech with sensitive infrastructure. We created this case study to show how a malicious actor (NK IT worker, synthetic identity, etc.) could target a real company through job postings that reveal too much about internal systems.
