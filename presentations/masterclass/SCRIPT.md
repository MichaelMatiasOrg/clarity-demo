**Duration:** ~5 seconds  
**Script:**
```
I'm Michael Matias, Co-Founder and CEO of Clarity.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 2: vero-hook
**Core message:** Your hiring process is a security vulnerability  
**Duration:** ~15 seconds  
**Script:**
```
In cybersecurity, we're used to thinking about breaking into companies through software. Vulnerabilities. Exploits. Zero-days.

Today, I want to talk about a different threat: breaking in through the front door.

Last night, I wanted to break into Vero Financial. Let me show you how I did it.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 3: vero-target
**Core message:** Even well-secured companies have this blind spot  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Vero Financial. Four point two billion dollars processed annually. One hundred eighty platform customers. A mature security perimeter. Regular penetration tests.

They do everything right. Except for one thing.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 4: entry-point
**Core message:** The attack vector is your careers page  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds  
**Script:**
```
They're hiring.

Six open roles. One stands out: Staff Software Engineer, Platform.

Hiring isn't doing anything wrong. It's just an opportunity.

This is my way in.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 5: why-role
**Core message:** One bad hire = complete access to your systems  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Why this role?

Production access to systems processing billions in transactions. Customer data. Account numbers. Transaction history. Vault access. API keys. The keys to the kingdom.

One hire. Complete access.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 6: meet-marcus
**Core message:** I can create a perfect fake candidate in minutes  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds  
**Script:**
```
So I created the perfect candidate.

Meet Marcus Chen. Senior Software Engineer. Seven years of experience. Stripe. Plaid. UC Berkeley.

Built in minutes. Tailored for this exact role.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 7: linkedin
**Core message:** Social proof is easily fabricated  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
LinkedIn profile. Five hundred connections. Endorsements from former colleagues. Work history at companies that won't respond to verification requests.

All fake. All built in an afternoon.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 8: resume
**Core message:** Credentials are easily fabricated  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds  
**Script:**
```
A resume built specifically for Vero. Financial services background. Payment processing experience. The exact tech stack they use.

Marcus isn't a generic candidate. He's designed to be irresistible to this specific company.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 9: interview-deepfake
**Core message:** Even live video interviews can be faked  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Here's where it gets scary.

On a video call, anyone can be anyone. Real-time deepfakes. Or a mule — someone else interviewing on Marcus's behalf.

Either way, the person you hire isn't the person you interviewed.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 10: voice-quiz
**Core message:** You can't tell AI voices from real ones  
**Duration:** ~8 seconds  
**Script:**
```
It's becoming nearly impossible to tell if you're talking to a human or a synthetic voice.

Do you think you could spot the difference?

Most people can't.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 11: background-check
**Core message:** Traditional checks don't catch synthetic identities  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Background check? All clear.

Traditional checks look for bad records. Criminal history. Employment disputes.

They don't verify the identity actually exists. And fake identities don't have bad records.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 12: every-stage
**Core message:** Every stage of hiring can be bypassed  
**Duration:** ~15 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Let's recap what Marcus can do.

Fake identity that passes screening. Deepfake video for interviews. Cloned voice that sounds authentic. Background check comes back clean.

Every single stage of your hiring process — bypassed.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved
