### Slide 1: intro
**Core message:** Setup - establishes credibility + paradigm shift  
**Duration:** ~15 seconds  
**Script:**
```
I'm Michael Matias, Co-Founder and CEO of Clarity.

In cybersecurity, we're used to thinking about breaking into companies through software. Vulnerabilities. Exploits. Zero-days.

Today, I want to talk about a different threat: breaking in through the front door.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 2: vero-hook
**Core message:** The hook - pulls them into the story  
**Duration:** ~8 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Last night, I wanted to test how easy this really is.

I picked a target: Vero Financial. Let me show you how I got in.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 3: vero-target
**Core message:** Even well-secured companies have this blind spot  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Vero Financial. Four point two billion dollars processed annually. One hundred eighty platform customers. A mature security perimeter. Regular penetration tests.

They do everything right. Except for one thing.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 4: entry-point
**Core message:** The attack vector is your careers page  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds  
**Script:**
```
They're hiring.

Six open roles. One stands out: Staff Software Engineer, Platform.

Hiring isn't doing anything wrong. It's just an opportunity.

This is my way in.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 5: why-role
**Core message:** One bad hire = complete access to your systems  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Why this role?

Production access to systems processing billions in transactions. Customer data. Account numbers. Transaction history. Vault access. API keys. The keys to the kingdom.

One hire. Complete access.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 6: meet-marcus
**Core message:** I can create a perfect fake candidate in minutes  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds  
**Script:**
```
So I created the perfect candidate.

Meet Marcus Chen. Senior Software Engineer. Seven years of experience. Stripe. Plaid. UC Berkeley.

Built in minutes. Tailored for this exact role.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 7: linkedin
**Core message:** Social proof is easily fabricated  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
LinkedIn profile. Five hundred connections. Endorsements from former colleagues. Work history at companies that won't respond to verification requests.

All fake. All built in an afternoon.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 8: resume
**Core message:** Credentials are easily fabricated  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds  
**Script:**
```
A resume built specifically for Vero. Financial services background. Payment processing experience. The exact tech stack they use.

Marcus isn't a generic candidate. He's designed to be irresistible to this specific company.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 9: interview-deepfake
**Core message:** Even live video interviews can be faked  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Here's where it gets scary.

On a video call, anyone can be anyone. Real-time deepfakes. Or a mule — someone else interviewing on Marcus's behalf.

Either way, the person you hire isn't the person you interviewed.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 10: voice-quiz
**Core message:** You can't tell AI voices from real ones  
**Duration:** ~8 seconds  
**Script:**
```
It's becoming nearly impossible to tell if you're talking to a human or a synthetic voice.

Do you think you could spot the difference?

Most people can't.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 11: background-check
**Core message:** Traditional checks don't catch synthetic identities  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Background check? All clear.

Traditional checks look for bad records. Criminal history. Employment disputes.

They don't verify the identity actually exists. And fake identities don't have bad records.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 12: every-stage
**Core message:** Every stage of hiring can be bypassed  
**Duration:** ~15 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Let's recap what Marcus can do.

Fake identity that passes screening. Deepfake video for interviews. Cloned voice that sounds authentic. Background check comes back clean.

Every single stage of your hiring process — bypassed.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

**Core message:** 25% high-risk is shocking  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds

Twenty-eight resumes. Seven came back high risk. Five medium risk.

That's twenty-five percent of their pipeline with serious fraud indicators.

One in four.
```

---

### Slide 16: globelife-findings
**Core message:** These are fabricated people  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```

Synthetic identity patterns. Burner phones. Employment history that doesn't match any database. Zero digital footprint. Email addresses created days before applying.

These aren't bad candidates. These are fabricated people.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

*Act 3 scripts to follow.*

## ACT 3: THE THREAT

### Slide 17: already-happening
**Core message:** This is a global problem  
**Duration:** ~15 seconds  
**Script:**
```
And it's not just Globe Life.

This is happening to companies around the world. North Korean operatives have infiltrated over three hundred US companies. KnowBe4 — a security company — hired one who started loading malware on day one.

If it can happen to a security company, it can happen to anyone.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 18: fortune-500
**Core message:** Fortune 500 CISOs are dealing with this now  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**

Dozens. Fortune 500. Already compromised.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 19: epidemic
**Core message:** The scale is staggering and accelerating  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
The numbers are staggering.

Amazon alone has blocked eighteen hundred suspected North Korean applicants. Infiltrations are up two hundred twenty percent in just twelve months.

And by 2028, Gartner predicts one in four candidate profiles will be fake.

This isn't slowing down. It's accelerating.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 20: hr-attack-surface
**Core message:** HR/hiring is the new attack vector  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds  
**Script:**
```
HR is the new attack surface.

You've secured your perimeter. Firewalls. Encryption. EDR. SIEM.

But your employees? That's the vulnerability. And every open role is an invitation.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 21: bad-hire-cost
**Core message:** The cost of a bad hire is massive  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
What happens when a bad hire gets through?

On average, two hundred forty thousand dollars. That's recruiting, onboarding, salary, severance, replacement.

And it takes six months to detect. Six months of access. Six months of trust.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 22: malicious
**Core message:** Malicious insiders are 20x worse  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
But that's just incompetence. What if they're malicious?

An insider threat doesn't cost two hundred forty thousand. It costs five million.

And it doesn't take six months to detect. It takes nearly ten months. Ten months of damage before you even know.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

## ACT 4: THE SOLUTION (Clarity)

### Slide 23: clarity-intro
**Core message:** Introducing Clarity  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds

End-to-end identity validation for the entire employee lifecycle. From the first resume to their last day on the job.

Know who you're hiring. And know it's still them.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 24: pipeline
**Core message:** See Clarity in action — threats blocked, legitimate hires proceed  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds

---

### Slide 25: command-center
**Core message:** Single dashboard for all identity risk

---

### Slide 26: pre-interview
**Core message:** Catch fakes before they even get an interview  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Before the interview even starts, Clarity flags the risk.

Synthetic identity patterns. AI-generated photos. Unverifiable employment history.

Marcus gets blocked before he wastes a single minute of interviewer time.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 27: during-interview
**Core message:** Post-interview analysis catches what humans miss  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
After the interview, Clarity analyzes the recording.

Face manipulation detected. Voice doesn't match lip movements. Identity doesn't match the application.

Flagged for expert review — a human confirms before any action is taken.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 28: continuous
**Core message:** Security doesn't stop at hire  
**Duration:** ~10 seconds  
**Script:**

```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 29: lifecycle
**Core message:** Identity verification is a lifecycle problem  
**Duration:** ~15 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Here's the thing most companies miss.

Identity verification isn't a hiring problem. It's a lifecycle problem.

Onboarding. MFA resets. Privileged access. Sensitive transactions. Every one of these moments is a vulnerability.

You need one system that knows your employee — and can verify them at every critical moment.

That's Clarity.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 30: two-pillars
**Core message:** Two questions CISOs are asking  
**Duration:** ~8 seconds  
**Script:**
```
You're asking two things.

Will this integrate with my workflow — or add another tool to manage?

And can it actually detect these threats?

Let me show you.
```
**Status:** [x] Approved

---

### Slide 31: integrations
**Core message:** Answer to question 1 — fits into existing workflow  
**Duration:** ~12 seconds  
**Script:**
```
Clarity integrates with the tools your teams already use.

Greenhouse, Lever, Workday for recruiting. Okta, ServiceNow for security and IT.

No new workflows to learn. No friction for recruiters. No disruption for candidates.
```
