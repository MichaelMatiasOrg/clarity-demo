# Clarity Presentation Narrative

## Story Arc

### Act 1: The Problem (Slides 1-10)
**Hook → Stakes → Urgency**

4. **Fortune 500 threats** — Real companies, real attacks

## Key Narrative Shifts

### Before (Feature Tour)
"Here's what we do" → "Here's how you manage it"

### After (Protagonist Journey)  
"Here's YOUR control center" → "Let's explore what you're seeing"

The CISO is the hero. The dashboard is their window into a protected organization. Each product screenshot is a drill-down into something they're already controlling.

## Slide-by-Slide Talking Points

### Slide 21: Command Center
> "This is what complete visibility looks like for your security team. Every employee's identity status, every threat blocked, real-time monitoring across your entire workforce. Let me show you what you're actually seeing here..."

### Slide 22: Pre-Interview Detection  
> "When an alert fires on your dashboard, this is what's happening behind the scenes. Before your team wastes a single minute in an interview, Clarity has already flagged the AI-generated profile photo, the missing employment records, the suspicious patterns."

### Slide 23: During Interview
> "Now let's say someone gets past the initial screen. This is what real-time protection looks like. Your recruiting team is on a video call, and Clarity is running detection in the background. Face manipulation — 96% confidence. Voice cloning detected. Interview paused automatically, security team notified."

### Slide 24: Continuous Verification
> "And protection doesn't stop at hiring. Every employee verified at onboarding is continuously monitored. Periodic checks, voice consistency, behavioral patterns. Because the question isn't just 'who did we hire?' — it's 'is it still them?'"

## Voice & Tone

- **Confident, not salesy** — We're showing capability, not pitching
- **CISO-centric language** — "Your view", "Your team", "Complete visibility"
- **Urgency without fear-mongering** — The threats are real; so is the solution
- **Technical credibility** — Confidence percentages, integration names, real stats
