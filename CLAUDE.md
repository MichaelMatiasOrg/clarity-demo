## What We're Building
A live demo for Michael's presentation showing how an AI-generated synthetic identity (Marcus Chen) can bypass hiring defenses and become an insider threat.

## The Story Arc
1. **Creation** — "Last night I created Marcus Chen"
2. **Spearphish** — Multiple vectors (LinkedIn, reference, inbound) to get to interview
3. **Interview** — AI candidate excels with camera ON
4. **Background Check Bypass** — SSN validates, no criminal record (because he's synthetic)
5. **The Math** — "1 in 10 interviews converts to offer. This isn't if, it's when."

## Presentation Flow

1. **Hook:** "In February 2024, a company lost $25 million to a video call where every participant was fake."

2. **Bridge:** "But that was a one-time scam. What if the goal isn't a quick payout — it's getting *inside* your company?"

3. **Demo:** "Last night, I created this person..."
   - Show LinkedIn (looks real)
   - Show resume (impressive background)
   - Show background check (ALL PASSED)
   - Show pay stub (establishes work history)

4. **The SSN Reveal:**
   - "Of course the SSN validated. Since 2011, SSA randomized assignment."
   - "Of course there's no criminal record. He was born yesterday."

5. **The Interview Question:**
   - "Could Marcus pass your interview with camera ON?"
   - Show D-ID avatar clip (if ready)
   - Reference the 17% stat

6. **The Math:** "1 in 10 interviews results in an offer. This isn't if — it's when."

7. **Solution:** Introduce Clarity

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. ✅ **BRANDING DOCUMENTED** - See `CLARITY-BRANDING.md`
2. **REBUILD SLIDES** - Update presentation with correct branding (Manrope font, `#61F393`, official logo)
3. **Create D-ID avatar video** - The "camera on" argument needs visual proof
4. **Test full presentation flow** - Run through all artifacts
