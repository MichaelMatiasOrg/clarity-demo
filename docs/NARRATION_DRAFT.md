# Clarity Presentation - Narration Script (DRAFT)

**Tone:** Professional cyber-security briefing. Clear, authoritative, focused on business risk. Like a CISO presenting to the board.

---

## Slide 1: intro
**Michael Matias, Co-Founder & CEO**

"What I'm about to show you represents one of the most significant security blind spots in enterprise today. It's not your firewall. It's not your endpoints. It's your hiring process."

**Duration:** 8s

---

## Slide 2: vero-hook
**Last night, I wanted to break into Vero Financial**

"Let me demonstrate with a real scenario. My target: Vero Financial. But I'm not going to hack their systems. I'm going to get hired."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 3: vero-target
**Vero Financial profile**

"Vero is a well-defended company. SOC 2 Type II certified. Regular penetration testing. Strong perimeter security. By traditional metrics, they're doing everything right."

**Duration:** 6s

---

## Slide 4: entry-point
**They're hiring**

"But they're hiring. Six open roles. And that's my entry point."

**Duration:** 4s

---

## Slide 5: why-role
**Why This Role - Platform Infrastructure**

"I'm targeting Platform Infrastructure. This role provides direct access to production systems, customer data, deployment pipelines, and internal credentials. One hire. Complete access."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 6: meet-marcus
**Meet Marcus Chen**

"So I built a candidate. Marcus Chen. Senior engineer, seven years experience, Berkeley graduate. Completely synthetic. Built in fifteen minutes."

**Duration:** 6s

---

## Slide 7: linkedin
**LinkedIn Profile**

"His LinkedIn is indistinguishable from a real profile. Five hundred connections. Endorsements. Work history at companies that rarely verify references. Every detail engineered to pass scrutiny."

**Duration:** 8s

---

## Slide 8: resume
**Resume**

"His resume aligns perfectly with the job requirements. Every date matches LinkedIn. Every reference is prepared to vouch for him."

**Duration:** 5s

---

## Slide 9: interview-deepfake
**The Interview - Real-time Deepfake**

"Marcus completes four video interviews. Recruiter screen. Technical round. Hiring manager. Executive review. All with glowing feedback. What they didn't know—every interview used a real-time deepfake. Face and voice, completely synthetic."

**Duration:** 11s

---

## Slide 10: voice-quiz
**Voice Demo**

"Voice cloning is equally accessible. Three voices—can you identify which is AI-generated? Most security professionals can't. And this technology is commercially available."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 11: background-check
**Background Check - All Clear**

"The background check returns clean. No criminal history. No red flags. Because Marcus has no history at all. Synthetic identities don't have a past to discover."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 12: every-stage
**Every Stage Bypassed**

"Every stage of the hiring funnel—bypassed. AI-generated identity for sourcing. Tailored resume. Deepfake interviews. Synthetic identity for background checks. Marcus now has an offer letter and access credentials."

**Duration:** 9s

---

## Slide 13: already-happening
**This is Already Happening**

"This isn't theoretical. The Department of Justice confirmed North Korean operatives infiltrated over three hundred US companies using these exact techniques. KnowBe4—a security awareness company—hired a fake employee who began deploying malware on day one."

**Duration:** 10s

---

## Slide 14: the-question
**The Question**

"If Marcus applied to dozens of companies last month, how many is he working at right now?"

**Duration:** 5s

---

## Slide 15: scale
**The Scale**

"One operator. Fifteen minutes per identity. Twenty identities per week. Two hundred applications. Multiple job offers. Every week. This is industrial-scale infiltration."

**Duration:** 8s

---

## Slide 16: fortune-500
**Fortune 500 Impact**

"We've spoken directly with Fortune 500 security teams. This is happening now, at scale, across every industry."

**Duration:** 5s

---

## Slide 17: epidemic
**The Epidemic**

"Gartner projects one in four candidate profiles will be fraudulent by 2028. The DOJ identified three hundred plus compromised companies. Infiltration attempts increased two hundred twenty percent in twelve months."

**Duration:** 8s

---

## Slide 18: hr-attack-surface
**HR is the New Attack Surface**

"Your perimeter is secure. Your firewall is hardened. But your hiring process? That's the vulnerability. HR is the new attack surface."

**Duration:** 6s

---

## Slide 19: bad-hire-cost
**Cost of a Bad Hire**

"A standard bad hire costs over two hundred forty thousand dollars in recruiting, onboarding, and replacement. Detection takes an average of six months."

**Duration:** 6s

---

## Slide 20: malicious
**Malicious Insider**

"But what if they're not just incompetent? Insider threat incidents average nearly five million dollars per breach. Detection and containment takes almost ten months."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 21: clarity-intro
**Introducing Clarity**

"Clarity provides end-to-end identity verification across the entire employee lifecycle. From first application to last day. Continuous assurance that your people are who they claim to be."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 22: pipeline
**End-to-End Protection**

"We integrate directly into your hiring workflow. Legitimate candidates pass through seamlessly. Threats are identified and blocked automatically."

**Duration:** 6s

## Slide 23: command-center
**The Command Center**

"This is your security team's view. Complete visibility into workforce verification status. Real-time threat detection. Ninety-nine percent verification coverage."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 24: pre-interview
**Before the Interview**

"Before any interview, Clarity flags synthetic identities, AI-generated photos, and employment inconsistencies. Threats blocked before they waste anyone's time."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 25: during-interview
**During the Interview**

"During live interviews, real-time detection identifies face manipulation, voice cloning, and identity mismatches. Interview paused. Security notified. Incident logged."

**Duration:** 8s

---

## Slide 26: continuous
**Continuous Verification**

"Protection continues post-hire. Day ninety. Day one-eighty. Ongoing verification confirms it's still the same person who was hired."

**Duration:** 6s

---

## Slide 27: lifecycle
**Employee Identity Lifecycle**

"The complete identity lifecycle—covered. Onboarding verification. Periodic checks. MFA resets. Privileged access requests. Identity confirmed at every critical moment."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 28: two-pillars
**Two Pillars**

"Clarity is built on two pillars: deep workflow integration and advanced fraud detection. Security tools fail when they create friction. We built for zero friction."

**Duration:** 7s

---

## Slide 29: integrations
**Workflow Integration**

"Native integration with your existing stack. Okta. ServiceNow. Workday. Slack. Zoom. No workflow changes required."

**Duration:** 5s

---

## Slide 30: fraud-detection
**Multi-Layer Detection**

"Multi-layered fraud detection. Deepfake analysis. Voice biometrics. Document forensics. Identity signal correlation. High-confidence threat identification."

**Duration:** 6s

---

## Slide 31: alerts
**Alert Routing**

"When threats are detected, alerts route automatically to the right teams through existing tools. Full audit trail. Every action logged. Zero manual handoffs."

**Duration:** 6s

---

## Slide 32: vs-traditional
**Why Clarity**

"Traditional background checks verify history—not identity. IDV platforms cover onboarding—not interviews. Video platforms enable calls—without deepfake detection. Clarity covers the complete surface."

**Duration:** 9s

---

## Slide 33: social-proof
**Trusted by Leaders**

"Clarity protects hiring at scale for industry leaders like Deel—verifying candidates across one hundred fifty countries."

**Duration:** 5s
