## 💡 Presentation Flow Suggestion

1. **Open with Arup:** "In February 2024, a company lost $25 million to a video call where every participant was fake."

2. **Bridge:** "But that was a one-time scam. What if the goal isn't a quick payout — it's getting *inside* your company?"

3. **Show Marcus Chen:** "Last night, I created this person..."
   - LinkedIn, resume, photos, background check, pay stub
   
4. **The interview question:** "Could Marcus pass your interview? Let me show you what interviewers are already facing..."
   - Reference the 17% stat
   - Show the Vidoc viral video if available
   - Reference Gartner's 1-in-4 projection

5. **The punchline:** "1 in 10 interviews results in an offer. This isn't if — it's when."
